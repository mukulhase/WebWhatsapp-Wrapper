# WebWhatsAPI (Based on web.whatsapp.com)

## What is it?
This package is used to provide a python interface for interacting with WhatsAPP Web to send and receive Whatsapp messages.


## Installation

##### Dependencies
You will need to install [Gecko Driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) separately, if using firefox, which is the default.

- Clone the repository
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the required packages.

#### From PyPI

`pip install webwhatsapi`

#### From pipenv

## Usage
1. Import library
` from webwhatsapi import WhatsAPIDriver `

2. Instantiate driver and set username
` driver = WhatsAPIDriver(username="mkhase") `
Possible arguments for constructor:
    - client : Type of browser. The default is Firefox, but Chrome and Remote is supported too.
    - username : Can be any value.
    - proxy: The proxy server to configure selenium to. Format is "<proxy>:<portnumber>"
    - command executor: Passed directly as an argument to Remote Selenium. Ignore if not using it.
    - loadstyles: Default is False. If False, doesn't load the styling in the browser.
	- profile: Pass the full path to the profile to load it. Profile folder will be end in ".default". For persistent login, open a normal firefox tab, log in to whatsapp, then pass the profile as an argument.


3. Use the get_qrcode() function to save the QR code in a file, for remote clients, so that you can access them easily. Scan the QR code either from the file, or directly from the client to log in.
` driver.get_qr() `

4. In case the QR code expires, you can use the reload_qr function to reload it
` driver.reload_qr() `

5. Viewing unread messages
` driver.view_unread() `

6. Viewing all contacts
` driver.get_all_chats() `

7. To send a message, get a Contact object, and call the send_message function with the message.
`<Contact Object>.send_message("Hello")`

8. Sending a message to an ID, whether a contact or not.
`driver.send_message_to_id(id, message)`
